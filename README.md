## Boat Image Classification
This project is directed towards creating a solid CNN to be used to classify images of boats from a Kaggle dataset. 

This project contains primarily different ways of approaching optimization and regularization of the images as well as how to organize them.

### Abstract
What this project completes is as follows:
  1) Clean up any underlying issues within the data
  2) Sort out a folder of images into a new directory for training
  3) Augment the data and create the image generators
  4) Set up several tests to work out the speed, accuracy, and loss of each Keras optimizer
  5) Test out several Convolutional Layers and Dense Layers
  6) Attempt some usage of Dropout and L1/L2 regularization
  7) Provide the end result test based on all of the previous testing.

### Installation
There is nothing to call but if you wish to replicate the work you will need the following dataset.

### Contributing
While this is a project--the modeling could always be refined and is welcome to anyone willing to give it a shot with the same tools.
